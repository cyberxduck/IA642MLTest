First: install the latest versions of Python 3, Java and WEKA on the machine if it is not already installed.
Second use the PIP tool to install “python-javabridge”, and then use PIP to install “python-weka-wrapper3”.
To test that everything is installed correctly: create a Python file and put “import weka.core.jvm as jvm” inside, then try and run it to see if it installed correctly.
Assuming that all has gone well, we will now test the program to prove efficiency.
Download “iris.arff” and put it in an easy to access directory.
Now run the BVW_WEKA_Test.py provided editing the location variable as instructed in the program.
The final result should be a chart that looks like this:

Naive Bayes Classifier
